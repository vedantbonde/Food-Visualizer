## üî• Description
ARPortions is a AR based food visualization application which aims to help consumer realize the real portions of food they are ordering or buying from a supermarket. The application uses ARCore and Android Studio to project the correct portions of the food to be ordered for the consumer. The consumer can then decide if he/she wants to order more or less portions of the required item to be bought. We have initially thought to integrate this service with Food Delivery applications like Swiggy and Zomato. We have also thought of implementing further additions to the application like choosing your drink preference and ingredients with the help of AR and seeing a cut through version of packaged goods in the retail supermarkets with such applications.
